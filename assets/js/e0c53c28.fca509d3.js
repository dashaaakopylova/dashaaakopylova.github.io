An EVM-based network transaction is an atomic unit and all transactions are executed individually and serially (atomically) by the miner when constructing a block. When one contract calls another contract, it actually means one continuous process executing bytecode with the state of accounts. Therefore, each next transaction relies on the completion of the previous one, regardless they are accessing the same account state or not. This way of executing transactions is synchronous, all transactions are processed in "the main program flow".'),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Venom by design has an asynchronous model of communication between accounts (and smart contracts). This is because of the need to maintain calls between contracts located in different shards, processed by different validator task groups. In this way each account (and smart contracts) has the only way to affect the state of some other account is by sending a message, the result of the execution of it will be a transaction. When you call a smart contract from another, it doesn't happen immediately. Your call creates an outbound message to a called smart contract and you must be expected to it will be executed in a current block or one of the next blocks. The order of execution of the outbound messages queue is guaranteed. But you can't predict the inbound messages queue in the external called contract, and what follows from this, then what state will the contract have at the time your message is processed."))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
